# drink-menu
Time to zhng the drink menu!

## Introduction
This is my (Gordon)'s attempt to zhng (enhance) the Metacamp drink menu.

Right now, the drink menu is just a sheet of paper, and future updates would be very unsustainable, both for the environment and for the inkjet printer.

## Goals

* Semi-interactive drink menu
* Drink price is tagged to USDC, and fluctuates accordingly with market rate
* Scan QR for _member price ooh yeah_
  * this means that the QR should check for the member NFT, auth it, then give you member price
* I guess an animated logo and visuals would be cool too

## Technologies used

* React Native
* Javascript
